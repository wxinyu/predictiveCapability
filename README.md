Predicting NBA Playoff Game Tree

Each year in NBA's playoff season, we have the top 8 teams from the east and the west. They battle against each other for the championship. Our program asks users to input these 16 teams that entered this year's playoff season and outputs the game tree of the entire playoff season--therefore, of course, allows us to predict the champion of this year's NBA playoff.


In order to use the program, please enter the 16 teams in the order of:
first place(east), eighth place(east), fourth place(east), fifth place(east), third place(east), sixth place(east), second place(east), seventh(east), first place(west), eighth place(west), fourth place(west), fifth place(west), third place(west), sixth place(west), second place(west), seventh(west)

(Note that, instead of commas, hit [enter] after entering each team's name)

The name of the team should be entered exactly in the form of "[city name][team name]". For example: San Antonio Spurs, Atlanta Hawks...etc

After correctly inputing the names of teams in this year's playoff season, the program will write a seprate file which contains the game tree (called "GameTree.csv")
